# Final Project: OpenStreetMap Scraping
##Collecting Data for DAT-102 Final Project from OpenStreetMap

I use csv document to get the list of U.S  states and randomly select
them as my samples. So it will give your sample states and their capitals
Then I use the OverPass API to scrape the information on the OpenStreetMap
to find how many museum/library/pub/coffee shop in the cities

Every country in the world is in a different stage of development. 
They have different geographical locations, different histories and cultures. 
Each small point of the city will make it different from others. 
Buildings are entities carrying information of cities, so I think analyzing the
data of public buildings in different cities is a good start point to study. 
We can through these data to know more about a country and their citizens.
